# Dicee

## Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to introduce you to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps youâ€™ll build in the future. This app will teach you a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat dice app.

## What I learned

* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug your app with the Xcode console.
